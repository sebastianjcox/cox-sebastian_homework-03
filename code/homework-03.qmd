Models

```{r}
#Null model
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, 
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Saturated model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: SLA & Water Treatment
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: SLA & Species
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: Water Treatment & Species
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

```

Comparing Models

```{r}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3,
          model4)
```

*Model 4* has the lowest AIC. Now, we will examine the diagnostic plots
to see if it is viable.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) #show the diagnostics as a 2x2 table
plot(model4)

```

The diagnostic plots look good: the residuals appear to be homoscedastic
and normally distributed, and it appears that there are not any outliers
that would impact the model predictions.

**b) Statistical Methods**

To explore the influence of specific leaf area (mm^2^/g), water
treatment (well-watered or drought-stressed), and species on plant mass,
I created and compared multiple linear regression models. One model
served as a baseline and contained no predictors (null model), one
contained all three predictors (saturated model), the the three
subsequent models contained each permutation of two of the predictors
(see **Table 1** for details). In order to decide upon the model that
best described how plant growth changes, I compared the Akaike
Information Criterions (AICs), which takes into account the accuracy of
the model's predictions and its complexity. The model with the lowest
AIC was *Model 4*, which has species and water treatment as predictors.
To ensure that *Model 4* adhered to linear model assumptions, I analyzed
Residual-Fitted and Scale-Location plots for homoscedasticity of
residuals, a QQ plot for normality of residuals, and a Cook's distance
plot for outliers. The diagnostic plots indicated that the model
conformed to the assumptions and was suitable for analysis.

**d) Caption**

**Figure 1. Total plant biomass differs across water treatments.** Data
from "Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and
improve restoration success?" (J. Valliere, et al., 2019). Points total
plant biomass (g) of plants grown in well watered (green) and drought
stressed (tan) environments. The diamonds represent model predictions
for the average biomass of each species in each water treatment, and the
error bars represent a 95% confidence interval about the predictions.

**e) Results**

The data analysis found that water treatment and species predicted total
plant biomass (linear regression, F(7,62) = 27.08, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05,
Multiple R^2^ = 0.7535). Based on model predictions, holding species
constant, water-watered plants weighed 0.117 ± 0.024g more than
drought-stressed plants (t = 2.225, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05). On average,
*Grindelia camporum* specimens had the greatest difference in weights
from *Acmispon glaber*, the reference species, of 0.313 ± 0.032g (t =
9.662, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05) and *Penstemon centranthifolius* the least,
only weighing 0.05 ± 0.032g more (t = 1.543, p = 0.128, α = 0.05),
though this result has low significance.

# Problem 2. Affective visualization

**a) Visualization Description**

Since my data are sourced from observations of my breakfast habits, I
could integrate the numerical data into a drawing of a bowl of oatmeal.
Each day of the week could represent a different topping for the bowl.
To illustrate the differences in breakfast durations across days, each
day's topping would be sized according to whether its average duration
is relatively longer or shorter. The day with the shortest duration
could be represented by a seed or nut, while the longest by a strawberry
or banana slice.

**c) Draft**

![](images/draft.jpg)

**d) Artist Statement**

My figure visualizes the duration of my breakfasts each morning. I eat
oatmeal to start my day, so the image depicts a bowl of oatmeal with a
different topping to represent each day of the week, sized according to
the average duration for me to finish my breakfast on that day. I was
inspired by Jill Pelto's paintings, specifically the way that they were
able to depict statistical data in a subtle way; her pieces can be
viewed first as a work of art, then as a form of depicting data. I
created this digital image on an iPad using an app called "Goodnotes." I
was new to both the app and the process of drawing with a stylus, so I
spent a long time using Google and trial and error to figure out what
the app was capable of, then began drawing using shape templates when
appropriate and freehand shading for the remainder.

# Problem 3. Statistical critique

**a) Revisit and summarize**

The authors used F-tests to examine the hypothesis the the distances
that birds migrate are shortening over time due to climate change. The
tables illustrate the different variables that they considered for their
final model, indicating whether or not each variable was included.

![](images/Table1.png)

![](images/Table2.png)

**b) Visual Clarity**

Table 1 is exceptionally clear: the variables are self-explanatory, the
F-statistic and associated p-value for each is given, justifying the
inclusion of the variable in the model. Table 2 contains much more
information and is less clear on its own. It includes the same metrics
as Table 1 for many more variables and separates those included and not
included in the final model. For those included, it provides model
estimates and standard errors. However, some of the variable names are
unclear and require an additional table that provides their meanings to
be fully understood.

**c) Aesthetic Clarity**

Table 1 is clean, uncluttered, and direct. Table 2 contains more
information so it inherently takes longer to analyze, but it could also
be improved with stylistic choices. Displaying the "included" or
"excluded" text in bold would make the separation between variable
categories more apparent, and the variables could have been sorted by
descending p-value to indicate which were most significant. Furthermore,
the values in the 'Estimate' column are quite far from the variable
names associated with them, so it is difficult to immediately make the
connection between the numbers and the associated variable.

**d) Recommendations**

The authors did not include a figure associated with the data presented
in these tables, but it may have been helpful to visualize the
differences in the accuracy of the predictor variables. The authors
could have included a bar graph with variables on the x-axis and
p-values on the y-axis. The variables could be sorted in decreasing
order of p-value, with the colors of each bar along a gradient from
lighter to darker. Since there is a large range of p-values, there
should be a jump in the y-axis from about 0.1 to 0.0001 to illustrate
each variable. Presenting the table data in this format would make it
easier for readers to identify which variables are the strongest
predictors, and making smaller p-values darker would provide a visual
indicator that the associated variables are 'weightier' and have a
greater effect on the response variable.
