Models

```{r}
#Null model
model0 <- lm(total_g ~ 1, 
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Saturated model
model1 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: SLA & Water Treatment
model2 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + water_treatment,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: SLA & Species
model3 <- lm(total_g ~ sla + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)
#Predictors: Water Treatment & Species
model4 <- lm(total_g ~ water_treatment + species_name,
             data = drought_exp_clean)

```

Comparing Models

```{r}
model.sel(model0,
          model1, 
          model2, 
          model3,
          model4)
```

*Model 4* has the lowest AIC. Now, we will examine the diagnostic plots
to see if it is viable.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) #show the diagnostics as a 2x2 table
plot(model4)

```

The diagnostic plots look good: the residuals appear to be homoscedastic
and normally distributed, and it appears that there are not any outliers
that would impact the model predictions.

**b) Statistical Methods**

To explore the influence of specific leaf area (mm^2^/g), water
treatment (well-watered or drought-stressed), and species on plant mass,
I created and compared multiple linear regression models. One model
served as a baseline and contained no predictors, one contained all
three predictors, the the three subsequent models contained each
permutation of two of the predictors (see **Table 1** for details). In
order to decide upon the model that best described how plant growth
changes, I compared the Akaike Information Criterions (AICs), which
takes into account the accuracy of the model's predictions and its
complexity. The model with the lowest AIC was *Model 4*, which has
species and water treatment as predictors. To ensure that *Model 4*
adhered to linear model assumptions, I analyzed Residual-Fitted and
Scale-Location plots for homoscedasticity of residuals, a QQ plot for
normality of residuals, and a Cook's distance plot for outliers. The
diagnostic plots indicated that the model conformed to the assumptions
and was suitable for analysis.

**c) Visualization**

```{r}
#storing model predictions
model_preds <- ggpredict(model4, 
                         terms = c("water_treatment", 
                                   "species_name"))

ggplot(drought_exp_clean, #use clean data set
       aes(x = water_treatment, #set axes
           y = total_g,
           color = water_treatment #color by water treatment
           )) +
  geom_point( #display data as points
             size = 1,
             alpha = 0.2) + #make the points transparent
  geom_line(data = model_preds, #use model predictions
            aes(x = x, y = predicted, group = group), #plot regression line
            color = "aquamarine4" , #change color
            size = 1,
            linetype = "dotted") + #make line dotted
  geom_line(data = model_preds, 
            aes(x = x, y = conf.low, group = group), #plot low end of confidence interval
            color = "darkblue" ,
            size = 0.5,
            linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line(data = model_preds, 
            aes(x = x, y = conf.high, group = group), #plot high end of confidence interval
            size = 0.5,
             color = "darkblue",
            linetype = "dotted") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + #rotate x-axis lables
  facet_wrap(~group) + #facet by species
  labs(x = "Water Treatment", #label graph
       y = "Total Biomass (g)",
       title = "Total Plant Biomass Differs Across Water Treatments")+
  theme(legend.position = "none") #remove legend
  

```

**d) Caption**

**Figure 1. Total plant biomass differs across water treatments.** Data
from "Can we condition native plants to increase drought tolerance and
improve restoration success?" (J. Valliere, et al., 2019). Points total
plant biomass (g) of plants grown in well watered (blue) and drought
stressed (red) environments. The larger-dashed line in the middle
connects the predictions for total plant biomass from a linear
regression model using species and water treatment as predictors. The
smaller-dashed lines above and below the regression line represent the
95% confidence interval for the regression

**e) Results**

The data analysis found that water treatment and species predicted total
plant biomass (linear regression, F(62,7) = 27.08, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05,
Multiple R^2^ = 0.7535). Based on model predictions, holding species
constant, water-watered plants weighed 0.117 ± 0.024g more than
drought-stressed plants (t = 2.225, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05). On average,
*Grindelia camporum* specimens had the greatest difference in weights
from *Acmispon glaber*, the reference species, of 0.313 ± 0.032g (t =
9.662, p \< 0.001, α = 0.05) and *Penstemon centranthifolius* the least,
only weighing 0.05 ± 0.032g more (t = 1.543, p = 0.128, α = 0.05),
though this result has low significance.

# Problem 2. Affective visualization

**a) Visualization Description**

Since my data are sourced from observations of my breakfast habits, I
could integrate the numerical data into a drawing of a bowl of oatmeal.
Each day of the week could represent a different topping for the bowl.
To illustrate the differences in breakfast durations across days, each
day's topping would be sized according to whether its average duration
is relatively longer or shorter. The day with the shortest duration
could be represented by a seed or nut, while the longest by a strawberry
or banana slice.

# Problem 3. Statistical critique

**a) Revisit and summarize**

The authors used F-tests to examine the hypothesis the the distances
that birds migrate are shortening over time due to climate change. The
tables illustrate the different variables that they considered for their
final model, indicating whether or not each variable was included.

![](images/Table2.png)

**b) Visual Recommendations**

The authors did not include a figure associated with the data presented in these
tables, but it may have been helpful to visualize the differences in the 
accuracy of the predictor variables. The authors could have included a bar graph
with variables on the x-axis and p-values on the y-axis. The variables could be 
sorted in decreasing order of p-value, with the colors of each bar along a
gradient from lighter to darker. Since there is a large range of p-values, there
should be a jump in the y-axis from about 0.1 to 0.0001 to illustrate each 
variable. Presenting the table data in this format would make it easier for 
readers to identify which variables are the strongest predictors, and making
smaller p-values darker would provide a visual indicator that the associated 
variables are 'weightier' and have a greater effect on the response variable.
